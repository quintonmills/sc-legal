        <h1>SKILL-BASED RULES</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 22, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Legal Notice:</strong> ScoreKings is a platform for skill-based analytical contests. Contests are won based on the user's knowledge of sports statistics and performance projections. These are not games of chance.
        </div>

        <h2>1. SKILL-BASED DETERMINATION</h2>
        <p>Every contest on ScoreKings requires the application of skill, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Evaluating historical player performance data.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Factors:</strong> Considering injuries, weather, and matchups.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Selecting a balanced roster or projection set to maximize points.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. CONTEST FORMAT</h2>
        <p>Users enter contests by submitting analytical "entries" based on player performance projections. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of these projections relative to real-world outcomes.</p>

        <h2>3. REWARDS & CREDITS</h2>
        <p>ScoreKings operates on a <strong>Credit-Based System</strong> to ensure compliance with regional regulations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Earning Credits:</strong> High-performing entries earn "Credits."</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Monetary Value:</strong> Credits are not legal tender and cannot be withdrawn as cash.</li>
            <li><strong>Redemption:</strong> Credits may be redeemed in the <strong>Rewards Store</strong> for third-party Gift Cards (e.g., Amazon, Apple).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. ELIGIBILITY & GEORGIA COMPLIANCE</h2>
        <p>In accordance with Georgia state law and "Underdog-style" operational flows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users must be 18+ years of age.</li>
            <li>Users must be physically located in a permitted jurisdiction (verified via geo-fencing).</li>
            <li>Outcome is determined strictly by the statistical performance of athletes, not by point spreads or the final score of a single team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. NO CHANCE INVOLVED</h2>
        <p>Contests are won by the participants who exercise the highest degree of skill. If a contest results in a tie, the platform utilizes pre-defined tie-breaking logic based on secondary statistical performance metrics.</p>
