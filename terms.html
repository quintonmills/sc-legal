        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 10, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
        <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the <strong>ScoreKings</strong> mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Age Requirements</h3>
        <p>You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher) to create an account or participate in any contest.</p>
        
        <h3>2.2 Location Restrictions</h3>
        <p>Participation in real-money contests is restricted to residents of jurisdictions where Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) are permitted by law. Real-money contests are strictly prohibited for users physically located in: <strong>Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and any other jurisdiction where DFS is restricted.</strong></p>

        <h2>3. GAME OF SKILL</h2>
        <p>You acknowledge that ScoreKings is a <strong>"Game of Skill."</strong> Winning depends on your knowledge of professional basketball, player statistics, and the ability to predict future performances based on historical data. Unlike gambling, the results are not determined by a random number generator or "house odds," but by the actual on-court performance of athletes in professional sporting events.</p>

        <h2>4. CONTEST RULES & ENTRY</h2>
        <h3>4.1 Entry Fees</h3>
        <p>Each contest requires a clearly defined entry fee. This fee is deducted from your App Wallet at the time of entry.</p>
        
        <h3>4.2 Scoring and Grading</h3>
        <p>Contests are graded based on official box scores from the leagues (e.g., OTE, NBA). Any changes to official statistics made by the league after a contest has been graded will not result in a retroactive change to payout distributions.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Payouts</h3>
        <p>Winners will receive a payout (e.g., 3x entry fee) deposited into their App Wallet following the manual or automated "grading" of the contest by Admin.</p>

        <h2>5. WALLET & PAYMENTS</h2>
        <h3>5.1 Deposits</h3>
        <p>Deposits are processed via Apple Pay or Stripe. Funds in your wallet are intended for use as entry fees.</p>
        
        <h3>5.2 Withdrawals</h3>
        <p>Withdrawal requests are subject to a 48-72 hour review period to prevent fraud. You may be required to provide tax information (W-9) if your annual net winnings exceed $600.</p>
        
        <h3>5.3 No Interest</h3>
        <p>User balances do not accrue interest and are not FDIC insured.</p>

        <div class="apple-disclaimer">
            <h2>6. APPLE INC. DISCLAIMER</h2>
            <p><strong>Note on Sponsorship:</strong> Apple Inc. is not a sponsor of, or involved in any way with, the contests, sweepstakes, or prizes offered within the ScoreKings app. All contests are organized and managed solely by ScoreKings.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>7. USER CONDUCT & ACCOUNT DELETION</h2>
        <h3>7.1 Multi-Accounting</h3>
        <p>Users are limited to one (1) account. Detection of multiple accounts for a single user will result in an immediate ban and forfeiture of funds.</p>
        
        <h3>7.2 Account Deletion</h3>
        <p>In compliance with Apple’s requirements, users may delete their account at any time via the "Profile" settings. Upon deletion, any remaining withdrawable balance will be returned to the user, provided it meets the minimum withdrawal threshold.</p>

        <h2>8. GEO-LOCATION SERVICES</h2>
        <p>To participate in real-money contests, you must enable Location Services. We use geo-fencing technology to verify your physical location. Any attempt to circumvent geo-fencing (via VPN or GPS spoofing) is a violation of these terms and will result in account termination.</p>

        <h2>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>ScoreKings is provided "as is." We are not responsible for technical errors, internet outages, or late-breaking player news (e.g., a player being benched) that affects your contest entry.</p>

        <h2>10. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the <strong>State of Georgia</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
